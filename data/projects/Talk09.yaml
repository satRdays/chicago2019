abstractTitle: "Recursive Package Dependencies: Unraveling A Tangled Web"
abstract: "What are you REALLY adding to your R package when you add that dependency?  Nearly all R packages have dependencies, or in other words, separate packages that are utilized to provide a set of functions for the original package.  They’re great.  Often, they provide stellar, community-validated code that would take significant time and effort to create yourself.  However, you’re relying on more than the code in a dependency—you’re counting on that dependency and all of its dependencies, recursively, to be stable: to be updated for newer versions of R, to be maintained with good versioning, and to have no breaking changes.  If not, then when any dependency fails, it can mean lots of work for you to resolve the issue.  In this talk, we’ll discuss best practices with package dependencies, including how to judge the true risk of a dependency and the effort to replace it."
