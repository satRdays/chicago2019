description: I'm a life insurance actuary and an enthusiastic user of R for many, many years. I graduated from the University of Chicago with a BA in Economics and have been working at Lincoln Benefit Life ever since. My latest interests include machine learning and data science, finding ways to apply R to actuarial science, and engaging with the R community.
