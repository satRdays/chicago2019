abstractTitle: "How Can We Make R More Accessible To Non-Coders?"
abstract: "In my research field, many are becoming avid users of R, but many are feeling left behind. In my classroom, students get a deeper understanding about statistics by modeling data in R, but they tune out or get anxious at the sight of the console. I am a cognitive psychologist, not a computer scientist, so I have also personally experienced the pain of the non-coder using R. I would like to share some ideas and some questions I have about introducing R in formal and informal learning environments."
