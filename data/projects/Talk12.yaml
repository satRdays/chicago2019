description: "Chase is currently a PhD candidate at the University of Illinois at Chicago where he is creating a platform to make the discovery of antibiotics and new drugs in general a little less serendipitous. He works at the intersection of natural product drug discovery, mass spectromety, and microbial biosynthesis. He has been on SCUBA expeditions to Iceland and the Apostle Islands and enjoys whitewater kayaking. He has been using R for 3 years."

abstract: "The past few years have shown vast improvements in workflows for reproducible and distributable research within the R ecosystem. This talk will highlight two recent open source R packages I have written that take advantage of this modern R ecosystem, along with conquered and prevailing challenges. 
The first is mzPlotter, which encapsulates the ease of creating high-quality, interactive, and reproducible reports with R. While simple and written in just a few hours, it is fast and robust enough that it’s being deployed in Docker alongside production bash and python code. Using mzR, plumber, ggplot, plotly, crosstalk, and rmarkdown, it ingests 100’s of MB of data and outputs a single-file, interactive summary report in just a few seconds.  
At the opposite end of the spectrum is a multi-thousand line shiny app, IDBac; the result of off-and-on work over several years and well-over a thousand hours of iteration, learning, and improvement. Part of this was recently adapting to new shiny tools (e.g. modularity and database pooling) as well as, opinionated best practices in large app creation.  
Both mzPlotter and IDBac have required introspection about how tools and pipelines we build as R programmers best interact with non-R-programmers, and non-programmers in general. This includes challenges in the distribution of data (Can your intermediate or final data be read by other languages?) and interactive analysis (How do you distribute shiny apps that are prohibitively expensive to run in the cloud?). To this end I will touch on how mzPlotter and IDBac were designed for multi-language support and provide an update on a current project to automate creating Electron distributable Shiny apps."
