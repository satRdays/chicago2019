abstractTitle: Spatial Point Pattern Analysis Of Retail Businesses
abstract: In this talk I will focus in the usage of R for studying firm demographics of the retail sector. Firm demographics study the life and death of corporations and industries using the formal methods of mathematical demography. While this approach has seen application at a macro level in economics and regional science; I study the coexistence of businesses at a micro level using detailed business establishment information on their location, obtained from the National Establishment Time Series (NETS) database. I will elucidate how I have used R and PostgreSQL together in order to query the data points from the spatial database. Then, I will apply point pattern analyses (using spatstat) to study the business location of births and deaths across different cities in the United States.
