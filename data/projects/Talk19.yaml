abstractTitle: "No Apis? No Problem. Automating Personalized Content Delivery With R And Excel."
abstract: "As R data scientist / analyst, we'd prefer to deliver our content/analysis/predictions, etc. in clean APIs, shiny apps, or fluid applications. Some times this is not possible for numerous reasons. Maybe your company has not fully adopted R. Maybe the technology infrastructure has not been worked out to use APIs, shiny apps, or web applications. Maybe you simply have not taken the technical dive to learn how to used more advanced tools for content delivery in R.

Whatever the reason, you still have some content right now that you want to deliver to users. Say it's 50 users, 100, 200? Well, there is a simple and low startup cost workflow that I have found to be useful for delivering personalized content to users without much technical debt. That method combines R, Excel, and email. The result is personalized Excel workbooks (macro free) for each user delivered right to their inbox. In a matter of 10 minutes or so, you will be able to utilize this workflow to meet your immediate needs for content delivery in R."
