description: Adam bounced around biology, economics, and biostatistics before finally falling in love with R thanks to his education at UC Davis.  He now works in insurance, which is what he tells people at parties to get them to go away.  He spends his days writing R, avoiding Python, and disparaging SAS.  He spends his weekends wrangling his three foster children.
abstractTitle: Building An Analytic Culture In Your Organization
abstract: The value of analytics is self-evident among data scientists and other practitioners, but analytics may be badly misunderstood, abused, or even feared outside your department.  In this session I explore options for demystifying various aspects of analytics for everyone from new data science hires, to casual analysts, to senior leadership.  I explain how Allstate is building an analytic culture and how you can begin doing the same with the resources at your disposal.
