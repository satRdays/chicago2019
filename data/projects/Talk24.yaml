abstractTitle: "Model Evaluation And Optimization With Real World Costs And Benefits"
abstract: "Many data science problems have unequal costs and benefits. Traditional methods of classifier evaluation (precision, F1, etc.) are inadequate.  This talk will provide an overview of the expected value framework.  We will discuss threshold optimization and return-on-investment techniques that are more appropriate for evaluating classifiers in the context of business value maximization."
