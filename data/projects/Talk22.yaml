abstractTitle: "Psychometrics & Unique Functions In The "Psych" Package"
abstract: "The "Psych" package contains functions useful for a variety of data analyses, functions tailored to assist with psychometric analyses, aesthetic data displays, and a collection of unique datasets to play with. The package also offers user-friendly, organized outputs of common functions, such as "describe." I will introduce and demonstrate how to use the following functions: "describe," "describeBy," "pairs.panels," "densityBy," "keys.list," "scoreItems," and "ICLUST," "ICLUST.graph.""
