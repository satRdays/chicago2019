abstractTitle: "Connecting Teams And Systems With R's Api Tools"
abstract: "Session will walk through how I used R to connect my company's two primary database systems, both of which had APIs but no out-of-the-box integration available. This involved using existing Github packages, building an API wrapper with httr, creating a package to house integration functions, and making the tool accessible for non-R users."
