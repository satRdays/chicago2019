description: Sherry is an Applied Data Scientist at Civis Analytics, where her days involve developing shiny apps and data pipelines, testing ways to improve predictive models, and advising clients on survey design and causal inference. Prior to Civis, she studied economics at the University of Chicago and did research at the Center for Data Science and Public Policy and the Center for the Economics of Human Development. Outside of data science and policy, Sherry spends time accidentally going on very long walks, cooking large amounts of vegetables, and telling people on the East Coast that Chicago isn’t a tundra.
abstractTitle: So You Want To Build A (Client-Facing) Shiny App?
abstract: In data science and consulting, Shiny apps are an increasingly popular option for delivering analysis and decision-making tools to non-technical clients. Shiny apps are fun to build, cool to use, and can be huge time-savers when they automate a time-consuming workflow. However, building a Shiny app for a client is not the same thing as building one for a personal project, and it is not the same thing as delivering a static deck. Delivering a client-facing Shiny app as a data scientist introduces a lot of important questions – Is Shiny capable of meeting the performance needs for your use case? How much input should you get from the client before you start building? How many features should you build into your first iteration? How should you balance client support and bug fixes with new development? 

In this talk, I’ll draw on my experience building a client-facing Shiny app to share some thoughts on all of the above questions. The talk will be a mix of technical tips and tricks on using Shiny in production, as well as more general thoughts on when you might choose to build, or not build, a Shiny app, and some ideas for approaching team collaboration and product development from a data science perspective.
