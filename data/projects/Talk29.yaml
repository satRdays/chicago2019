description: Sherry is an Applied Data Scientist at Civis Analytics, where her days involve developing shiny apps and data pipelines, testing ways to improve predictive models, and advising clients on survey design and causal inference. Prior to Civis, she studied economics at the University of Chicago and did research at the Center for Data Science and Public Policy and the Center for the Economics of Human Development. Outside of data science and policy, Sherry spends time accidentally going on very long walks, cooking large amounts of vegetables, and telling people on the East Coast that Chicago isnâ€™t a tundra.
